# To Do 

- Write a real Read ME 
- Figure out a solution to move gem requirements into the extensions files, rather than in editor.rb or em_file.rb
- Deal with multiple-word extension name
- Make a real CLI: edit em files, create a new extension, re-convert one particular existing file
- Write an introductory blog post
- Write a new extension just for simple, block quote tweet embeds (and figure out how good they look when pasted in to GMail)
